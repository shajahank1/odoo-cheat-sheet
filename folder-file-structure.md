# Odoo
Odoo is a comprehensive suite of business management applications, and its functionality is primarily divided into modules. Each module in Odoo encapsulates a specific set of business functions, like CRM, sales, inventory, accounting, HR, etc.

## Understanding Odoo Modules
What is a Module: In Odoo, a module is akin to a plugin or an extension. It's a collection of functionalities that can be independently installed, upgraded, and maintained. Modules can add new features to Odoo's system, modify existing features, or provide integrations with external systems.

> Both server and client extensions are packaged as modules which are optionally loaded in a database. A module is a collection of functions and data that target a single purpose.

> Odoo modules can either add brand new business logic to an Odoo system or alter and extend existing business logic. One module can be created to add your country’s accounting rules to Odoo’s generic accounting support, while a different module can add support for real-time visualisation of a bus fleet.

> Everything in Odoo starts and ends with modules.


### Modular Structure: 
The modular architecture of Odoo allows businesses to start with a minimal set of features and add more as their needs evolve. This modularity makes Odoo highly scalable and customizable.

### Types of Modules: 
There are core modules, which are developed and maintained by Odoo SA, and community modules, which are contributed by the broader Odoo community. Core modules cover standard business needs, while community modules can offer more specialized or localized functionalities.

## Structure of an Odoo Module
Each Odoo module typically contains several directories and files, each serving a specific purpose:

_**__init__.py:**_ _A Python file that initializes the module as a Python package. It typically contains imports for the module's Python files._

_**__manifest__.py:** This file contains metadata about the module, such as its name, version, dependencies, author, description, and data files._

_**models/:** This directory contains Python files defining the module's data models (Odoo ORM models), representing database tables._

_**views/:** Contains XML files defining the frontend components, like forms, lists, and menus._

_**security/:** Holds CSV or XML files for access control lists (ACLs) and record rules._

_**controllers/:** Contains Python files for managing web controllers, which handle HTTP requests and responses._

_**data/:** Often includes XML or CSV files for initial or demo data._

_**static/:** Used for static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images._

_**wizards/:** Contains Python and XML files for transient models, which are used for wizard-like user interfaces._
