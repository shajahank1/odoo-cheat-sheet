# QWeb Templates
QWeb is Odoo's primary templating engine used for generating HTML snippets and pages. It's an XML-based template language and is used extensively in both frontend and backend applications. QWeb templates are powerful tools for rendering dynamic content, making them essential for creating custom views, reports, and website pages in Odoo.

### Key Features of QWeb Templates
- XML-Based: QWeb templates are written in XML, ensuring a structured and hierarchical design.

- Dynamic Content Rendering: Supports expressions and statements for dynamic content generation, using Odoo's ORM to fetch and display data.

- Template Inheritance: Allows templates to extend or inherit from other templates, promoting reusability.

- Directives: Uses a set of specific directives (like t-if, t-foreach, t-esc, t-raw) for controlling logic and flow within the template.

- Customization: Can be customized to fit specific business requirements, allowing for the creation of unique and tailored user interfaces and reports.

### Basic Structure of a QWeb Template
> A QWeb template typically includes static HTML along with QWeb directives for dynamic content. Here's an example of a simple template:

```
<t t-name="my_module.template_name">
    <h1>Welcome, <t t-esc="user.name"/></h1>
    <ul>
        <t t-foreach="products" t-as="product">
            <li><t t-esc="product.name"/>: $<t t-esc="product.price"/></li>
        </t>
    </ul>
</t>
```
### In this template:

t-name assigns a unique name to the template.  
t-esc is used to insert text content safely, escaping HTML characters.  
t-foreach and t-as are used for looping over a collection.  
### Use in Odoo
- Website and eCommerce: QWeb is heavily used in website building and eCommerce modules for rendering dynamic webpage content.

- Reports: In reporting, QWeb templates are used to design and generate PDF or HTML reports. For instance, invoice or sales order templates.

- Email Templates: QWeb is also used for creating dynamic email templates in Odoo.

### Template Inheritance
> QWeb supports template inheritance, which allows you to extend or modify existing templates. This feature is particularly useful for customizing reports or views without altering the original templates.

### Best Practices
- Clear and Maintainable Code: Write templates that are easy to understand and maintain, with clear structuring.
- Use Directives Appropriately: Understand and use QWeb directives correctly for efficient template behavior.
- Keep Business Logic Separate: Avoid embedding complex business logic directly in templates; it's better to prepare data in models or controllers.
> QWeb Templates in Odoo provide a flexible and powerful way to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces, enhancing the user experience and allowing for a high degree of customization.
