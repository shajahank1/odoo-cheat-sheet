# Odoo's architecture
Odoo's architecture is robust and flexible, allowing it to cater to a wide range of business needs. It's a modular system, built primarily using Python and utilizing PostgreSQL for database management. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

## 1. Modular Structure
Modules: Odoo operates on a modular structure, which means its functionality is divided into modules. Each module corresponds to a business function, like sales, CRM, accounting, inventory, etc.
Customization and Scalability: This modular approach allows for easy customization and scalability. You can start with a few modules and add more as your business grows.
## 2. Three-Tier Architecture
Odoo follows a three-tier architecture, which includes:

### a) Database Tier (PostgreSQL)
_ Database Management: Uses PostgreSQL, a powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- Data Storage: All data generated and used by Odoo (such as user data, configuration settings, and transaction records) is stored in the PostgreSQL database.
### b) Server Tier (Odoo Server)
- Core Server: The Odoo server is the core of the system and is responsible for processing business logic, interacting with the database, and serving the web client.
- Odoo Framework: It includes a complete framework offering various services including ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), workflow engine, report engine, user and group management, etc.
- APIs for Integration: Provides APIs (XML-RPC, JSON-RPC) for integration with other systems.
### c) Client Tier
- Web Client: A dynamic and responsive web interface that interacts with the Odoo server via HTTP/HTTPS. It's built using JavaScript and uses a combination of jQuery, QWeb (Odoo's templating engine), and other libraries.
- Odoo.sh / Odoo SaaS / On-Premise: Deployment can be on Odoo's own cloud (Odoo.sh), as a SaaS solution, or on-premises on your own servers.
### 3. Technical Stack
- Languages: Primarily Python, with JavaScript for the web client and XML for view definitions and data files.
- Web Server: Uses Werkzeug, a WSGI toolkit for Python, as its web server.
- User Interface: The UI is built using a combination of HTML, JavaScript (JQuery, QWeb), and CSS.
### 4. Additional Components
- Odoo SH (Odoo's Cloud Platform): A platform specifically designed for Odoo that provides advanced deployment features like testing, building, and production environments in the cloud.
- Reporting: QWeb templating for generating reports in various formats (PDF, HTML, etc.).
- Custom Development: Allows custom module development for specific business needs using its comprehensive API.
### 5. Data Access and Security
- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Provides a high-level interface for database operations, making it easier to work with data in Python.
- Security: Role-based access control, data encryption, and session management.
### 6. Integration and Extensibility
- APIs and Web Services: Allows integration with third-party systems and services.
- Custom Module Development: Developers can create custom modules to extend the functionality of Odoo.
> In summary, Odoo's architecture is a multi-tier, modular system designed for flexibility and scalability, employing a mix of technologies like Python, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL. This design makes it adaptable for a wide range of business applications, from small companies to large enterprises.
