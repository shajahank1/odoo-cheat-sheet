# Implementing business logics 
Implementing business logic in Odoo involves using its powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) capabilities, server actions, automated actions, and other extension mechanisms. Let's go through the key methods for implementing business logic in Odoo:

## 1. Model Methods
> The most common way to implement business logic in Odoo is through methods in model classes. These methods can be triggered by user actions or server-side processes.

**CRUD Methods Override:** Override create, write, unlink, etc., to add custom behavior during these operations.
Custom Methods: Define your own methods in models for specific business logic. These can be triggered by buttons in views, server actions, etc.
**Example:**
```
from odoo import models, api

class MyModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'my.model'

    @api.model
    def create(self, vals):
        # Custom logic before creating a record
        record = super(MyModel, self).create(vals)
        # Custom logic after creating a record
        return record

    def my_custom_method(self):
        # Business logic here
```
## 2. Server Actions
Server actions are used to execute Python code and are ideal for complex business logic. They can be triggered from UI elements like buttons.
**Example:**
- Define a server action in XML and link it to a method in a model.
- Execute the action from a button in a form view.
## 3. Automated Actions and Scheduled Jobs
For business logic that needs to be executed periodically or based on certain triggers, use automated actions or define scheduled jobs (cron jobs).

**Automated Actions:** Set up actions that are triggered by data changes.
**Cron Jobs:** Schedule regular tasks like daily reports, data synchronization, etc.
**Example:**
- Define a cron job in XML to call a method at regular intervals.
- Automated action to check and update records when certain fields change.
## 4. Workflow Business Logic
> Although Odoo has deprecated the old workflow engine, you can still implement workflow-like logic using automated actions and server actions.
- State Management: Use fields to manage the state of a record.
- Actions on State Change: Trigger server actions when the state changes.

## 5. Onchange Methods
Use @api.onchange decorators for methods that should react to changes in the UI, providing dynamic feedback or auto-filling fields.

## 6. Computed Fields
Use @api.depends for fields whose value is computed based on other field values. This is crucial for keeping data consistent and up-to-date.

### Best Practices:
- Modularize Logic: Keep your business logic modular and reusable. Avoid duplicating code.
- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and validation to ensure data integrity.
- Performance Consideration: Be mindful of the impact of your logic on performance, especially in methods that are called frequently or on large datasets.
- Security: Ensure that your methods respect Odoo's security and access control mechanisms.
> By utilizing these methods, you can implement a wide range of business logic in Odoo, from simple validations to complex, automated workflows. Remember to leverage Odoo's existing frameworks and tools, as they provide a solid foundation for most common business requirements.
