# Compute methods 
Compute methods in Odoo are special methods used to define the value of computed fields. These fields do not directly store data in the database; instead, their values are calculated dynamically through Python functions.

## Characteristics of Compute Methods
- Dynamic Calculation: The value of a computed field is calculated on the fly, typically based on other field values.

- Not Stored by Default: Computed fields are not stored in the database by default. Their values are calculated each time they are accessed. However, you can choose to store them.

- Dependencies: Compute methods should specify their dependencies using the @api.depends decorator. This ensures that the computed field is recalculated whenever the dependent fields change.

## Creating Compute Methods
- Define the Field: Declare a computed field in your model, specifying the compute attribute with the name of the computing method.
- Create the Compute Method: Define the method for calculating the field's value. Use the @api.depends decorator to indicate field dependencies.
### Example of Compute Methods
Let's consider an example in a hypothetical sale.order model, where we want to compute the total amount of an order based on its line items.

Python Code in an Odoo Model:

```
from odoo import api, models, fields

class SaleOrder(models.Model):
    _name = 'sale.order'

    order_line_ids = fields.One2many('sale.order.line', 'order_id', string='Order Lines')
    total_amount = fields.Float(compute='_compute_total_amount', string='Total Amount')

    @api.depends('order_line_ids.price_total')
    def _compute_total_amount(self):
        for record in self:
            record.total_amount = sum(line.price_total for line in record.order_line_ids)
```
In this example:

- Computed Field: total_amount is a computed field on the sale.order model.
- Compute Method: _compute_total_amount is the method used to compute the total amount. It is decorated with @api.depends, indicating that the computation depends on the price_total of the order_line_ids.
- Calculation Logic: The method calculates the sum of the price_total from all order lines and assigns it to total_amount.
### Usage and Best Practices
- Efficiency: Consider whether the computed field should be stored. Storing can improve performance but takes up database space.
- Dependencies: Correctly specifying dependencies is crucial for ensuring the computed field is updated accurately.
- Error Handling: Handle potential errors in computation, especially when dealing with complex calculations.
- Readability: Keep the logic in compute methods readable and maintainable, as they can become complex.
- Recordset Operations: Remember that you're typically working with recordsets in compute methods. Use recordset operations effectively.
> Compute methods are essential for representing dynamic data in Odoo. They allow for sophisticated representations of data that can adapt to changes in related fields, enhancing the application's responsiveness and flexibility.
