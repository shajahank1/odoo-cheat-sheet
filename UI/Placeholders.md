## Placeholders
> In Odoo, placeholders are text hints displayed within form fields before any value is entered. These are used to provide additional guidance to the user about the expected type of input or format for the field. Placeholders are particularly helpful in improving user experience by giving context or instructions directly in the input interface without cluttering the UI with extra labels or help texts.

### Purpose of Placeholders
#### Placeholders serve multiple purposes:

- Guidance: They offer cues about what users should enter, reducing errors and confusion.
- Example Format: Especially for data that requires a specific format (like phone numbers, dates, or custom codes), placeholders can demonstrate the expected format.
- Visual Cleanliness: They help keep the interface clean and focused by avoiding additional descriptive elements.
### Implementation in Odoo
To use placeholders in Odoo, you can add the placeholder attribute directly to a field in a form view. This attribute works with various field types like char, text, integer, and even date fields, although it's most commonly seen with text inputs.

#### XML View Definition
Hereâ€™s how you might define placeholders in an XML view for a model in Odoo:

```
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="view_form_example_model" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">example.model.form</field>
            <field name="model">example.model</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <form string="Example Model">
                    <sheet>
                        <group>
                            <field name="email" placeholder="e.g., user@example.com"/>
                            <field name="phone" placeholder="Enter your phone number"/>
                            <field name="description" placeholder="Describe your experience..."/>
                        </group>
                    </sheet>
                </form>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```
### Practical Usage
Here are a few scenarios where placeholders can be particularly useful:

- Contact Forms: For fields like email, phone number, or website, placeholders can show the expected format or example input.
- Search Boxes: In search fields, placeholders can prompt users on what they can search for, like "Search by name or ID".
- Custom Forms: In forms where users need to input data in a specific format, placeholders can guide them without needing to refer to external documentation.
### Styling and Customization
While Odoo does not provide direct styling options for placeholders within the framework, you can customize their appearance using custom CSS. For example, you might change the color or font style of placeholders to match your company's branding or to make them stand out more clearly against the input field background.

### Conclusion
> Placeholders are a simple yet powerful tool for enhancing user interaction within Odoo forms. They aid in data entry by reducing user errors and improving the efficiency of form completion. By integrating thoughtful, clear placeholders into your application, you can enhance the overall usability and user satisfaction.
