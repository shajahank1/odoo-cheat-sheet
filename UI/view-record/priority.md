## Explain Priority
In Odoo, the concept of priority within views is used to determine the order of importance or execution sequence for view definitions, particularly when there are multiple views of the same type that apply to the same model. This is especially relevant when views are being inherited and extended in modular Odoo applications.

### Purpose of Priority in Views
The priority attribute in Odoo views helps in controlling the order in which views are applied when multiple inheritances or extensions occur on the same view type for a specific model. This can be crucial for ensuring that certain modifications or customizations take precedence over others.

### Usage of Priority
- Default Priority: By default, all views in Odoo have a priority of 16. Lower values indicate higher priority, meaning they are processed earlier.
Inheritance and Overrides: When extending or inheriting from an existing view, setting a lower priority on the new view ensures that it gets applied before other inherited views with a higher priority number.
### Example Implementation
> Suppose you have a base module that defines a form view for a model my.model, and you have two custom modules that both extend this form view. You might want to ensure that one of the extensions, which includes more critical changes, is always applied first, regardless of the module installation order.

```
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="view_form_my_model_base" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">my.model.form.base</field>
            <field name="model">my.model</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <form>
                    <!-- Base form elements -->
                </form>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```
Extension Module 1 (Lower Priority)
```
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="view_form_my_model_extension_1" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">my.model.form.extension.1</field>
            <field name="model">my.model</field>
            <field name="inherit_id" ref="base_module.view_form_my_model_base"/>
            <field name="priority" eval="10"/>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <xpath expr="//form" position="inside">
                    <!-- Critical modifications go here -->
                </xpath>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```
Extension Module 2 (Higher Priority)
```
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="view_form_my_model_extension_2" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">my.model.form.extension.2</field>
            <field name="model">my.model</field>
            <field name="inherit_id" ref="base_module.view_form_my_model_base"/>
            <field name="priority" eval="15"/>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <xpath expr="//form" position="inside">
                    <!-- Less critical modifications go here -->
                </xpath>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```
### Best Practices for Using Priority
Keep Defaults When Possible: Use the default priority unless there is a specific need to alter the order of view application.
Use Minimal Variation: Only slightly adjust the priority from the default (or from other custom views) to ensure minimal disruption and clearer control over view application order.
Document Priority Reasons: Always document the reason for assigning a specific priority, especially when working in a development team or when the view modifications are complex.
### Conclusion
> Using the priority attribute in Odoo views allows developers to control the sequence in which views are processed and applied. This is particularly useful in systems with heavy customization and modular extensions, ensuring that critical changes are always applied in the correct order, maintaining system integrity and functionality as intended.
