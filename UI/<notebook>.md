## <notebook>
> In Odoo's XML views, the <notebook> tag is used to organize data into tabbed sections within a form view. This organization method is particularly useful when dealing with forms that have a lot of data spread across different categories, as it helps improve the usability and navigability of the interface.

### Key Properties of the <notebook> Tag
The <notebook> tag itself does not have a lot of properties, but its role in organizing content into tabs (pages) is crucial for complex forms:

- invisible: This attribute allows you to dynamically hide the notebook based on specific conditions, similar to other UI elements in Odoo.
### Usage of <notebook>
> The <notebook> is primarily a container for <page> elements, each representing a tab in the form view. Here’s how you typically structure it:

- <notebook>: Defines the start of the tabbed area.
- <page>: Each page represents a tab within the notebook. Pages have their own attributes:
  - string: The name of the tab, displayed in the UI.
  - invisible: A condition under which the tab is hidden.
  - autofocus: A boolean attribute that, if set to true, focuses this tab when the form is opened.
#### Example: Employee Form with Notebook
Here’s an example of using a <notebook> in an employee form view to separate personal information, job details, and contact information into different tabs.

```
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="view_form_example_employee" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">example.employee.form</field>
            <field name="model">example.employee</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <form string="Employee Form">
                    <sheet>
                        <group>
                            <field name="name"/>
                        </group>
                        <notebook>
                            <page string="Personal Information">
                                <group>
                                    <field name="birthdate" widget='date'/>
                                    <field name="gender"/>
                                </group>
                            </page>
                            <page string="Job Details">
                                <group>
                                    <field name="department_id"/>
                                    <field name="job_id"/>
                                </group>
                            </page>
                            <page string="Contact Information" autofocus="True">
                                <group>
                                    <field name="work_phone"/>
                                    <field name="work_email"/>
                                </group>
                            </page>
                        </notebook>
                    </sheet>
                </form>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```
#### In this example:

The form is organized into three tabs: Personal Information, Job Details, and Contact Information.
Each tab is represented by a <page> element within the <notebook>.
The autofocus attribute is used on the "Contact Information" tab to focus it when the form is opened, highlighting its importance or frequent use.
#### Practical Usage
The use of <notebook> and <page> tags is particularly beneficial in scenarios where user roles require different data visibility or interaction levels. You can dynamically hide or show tabs based on user roles or other conditions using the invisible attribute. This feature ensures that users only see relevant information, which simplifies the interface and enhances data security.

### Conclusion
> The <notebook> tag in Odoo forms is a powerful tool for organizing complex data sets into manageable sections. By properly utilizing notebooks and pages, you can enhance the user experience, making large forms easier to navigate and interact with while maintaining a clean and efficient UI layout.
