## how to use qweb with normal form view

> Using QWeb templates directly within a standard form view in Odoo isn't the typical use case, as QWeb is primarily designed for generating reports, emails, and website content. However, there are scenarios where you might want to use QWeb-like functionality within a form view, such as dynamically displaying complex data that isn't straightforward to manage with standard Odoo fields and widgets.

### Integrating QWeb with Form Views
To achieve a QWeb-like integration within a form view, you can use computed fields or HTML fields to generate HTML content dynamically, and then render this content directly within the form view. Here’s how you can implement this:

#### Step 1: Define a Computed HTML Field
Add a computed field in your model that generates HTML content based on the data in other fields. This field will use HTML strings which can be rendered in the form view.

```
from odoo import models, fields, api
from odoo.tools.safe_eval import safe_eval

class YourModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'your.model'
    _description = 'Your Model Description'

    name = fields.Char(string="Name")
    dynamic_html_content = fields.Html(
        string="Dynamic Content",
        compute="_compute_dynamic_html_content"
    )

    @api.depends('name')  # depends on whatever fields influence the HTML content
    def _compute_dynamic_html_content(self):
        for record in self:
            if record.name:
                record.dynamic_html_content = f"<p>Hello, <b>{record.name}</b>! Here's some dynamic HTML content.</p>"
            else:
                record.dynamic_html_content = "<p>Set your name to see dynamic content!</p>"
```
#### Step 2: Add the HTML Field to the Form View
In your XML view definition, include the HTML field. Odoo will render the HTML as part of the form.

```
<odoo>
    <record id="view_form_your_model" model="ir.ui.view">
        <field name="name">your.model.form</field>
        <field name="model">your.model</field>
        <field name="arch" type="xml">
            <form string="Your Model Form">
                <sheet>
                    <group>
                        <field name="name"/>
                        <field name="dynamic_html_content" widget='html' sanitize=False/>
                    </group>
                </sheet>
            </form>
        </field>
    </record>
</odoo>
```
- Note: The sanitize=False attribute in the field definition allows the HTML to include style attributes and other HTML tags that are usually sanitized out. Be cautious with this setting to avoid cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

- Alternative Method: Using Server Actions to Render QWeb
If you specifically need to use QWeb templating capabilities (e.g., for more complex templates with loops, conditionals, etc.), you can create a server action that renders a QWeb template to a field or generates a downloadable file. However, this method is less common for displaying data directly within form views and is more suitable for actions like generating reports or downloadable content.

### Conclusion
> While standard form views in Odoo don't directly support QWeb templates in the same way as reports or website pages, you can mimic this functionality using HTML fields and computed fields. This approach allows for dynamic content generation within form views based on the data in the model. For more complex templating needs, consider using server actions or extending your model's methods to render QWeb templates programmatically.


# how danger if i give sanitize = false with html widget. is there any possibiity from external attack

> Using sanitize=False with the HTML widget in Odoo can potentially open up security risks, particularly from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This setting should be used with caution, especially in environments where the content of the HTML field might be provided by or influenced by users.

## Understanding the Risks
### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
XSS attacks occur when malicious scripts are injected into web pages viewed by other users. If you set sanitize=False, it allows HTML content, including JavaScript code, to be rendered as-is. This means that if the HTML content includes malicious JavaScript, it could be executed in the browser of anyone who views that content. This could lead to several security issues, such as:

Stealing cookies or session tokens.
Manipulating or stealing personal data.
Phishing attacks by altering the appearance of the page.
### 2. Data Integrity and Manipulation
Malicious scripts could manipulate data displayed on the page or even submit data falsely on behalf of the user, leading to corrupt or unauthorized transactions.

#### Safe Practices
To mitigate these risks while still using dynamic HTML content, consider the following practices:

- A. Use Built-in Sanitization
By default, Odoo’s HTML fields sanitize input to strip out potentially harmful tags and attributes, including <script> tags and onclick attributes. This should be sufficient for most use cases where HTML content needs to include basic formatting but not active JavaScript.

- B. Validate and Sanitize Manually
If you need finer control over what is allowed through the sanitization process, you could implement additional validation and sanitization routines in your server-side code before the content is saved to the database. Libraries like lxml or bleach in Python can be configured to allow certain HTML tags while stripping others.

- C. Restrict Who Can Modify HTML Content
Limit the ability to enter HTML content to trusted administrators or users. By controlling who can input HTML, you reduce the risk of an injection attack. This is especially important in multi-user environments.

- D. Educate Users
If users are allowed to input HTML, educate them about the risks and guidelines for safe HTML usage. Ensuring that users understand what content is acceptable can help prevent accidental security breaches.

- E. Regular Security Audits
Regularly audit your application and its security measures. This includes reviewing who has the ability to input HTML and whether any vulnerabilities have been reported for the libraries you use.

## Conclusion
> Setting sanitize=False can be dangerous because it disables Odoo’s built-in protection against XSS attacks. If you must use this setting for a legitimate reason, ensure that you implement robust security measures to mitigate the risks. Always consider whether less risky alternatives can achieve the same functionality.


# if make the field as display only, still have the risk?

> Even if an HTML field is set to display-only (read-only) in an Odoo form view, there can still be security risks if you use sanitize=False. The key issue here isn't whether the field can be edited by the user, but rather what content can be rendered in the user's browser when they view the field.

### Understanding the Risk with Display-Only Fields
When a field in Odoo is marked as display-only, it prevents users from editing the content directly through the UI. However, if the HTML content of the field contains malicious scripts and you've disabled sanitization (sanitize=False), these scripts will still execute when the HTML is rendered in the browser. This scenario can lead to the following issues:

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious scripts embedded in the HTML content can execute. XSS can lead to various security breaches, including session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user, and data theft.
Persistence of Malicious Content: Since the content is saved in the database without sanitization, it remains harmful every time it's rendered until it's cleaned or removed. This means every user with access to view the content is at risk.
### Security Measures
To securely use HTML content in Odoo, even for display-only fields, consider these security measures:

- Enable Sanitization: It's safest to leave the sanitization enabled (sanitize=True), which is the default behavior. Odoo's sanitization process removes potentially dangerous tags and attributes from the HTML, mitigating the risk of XSS.
- Server-Side Validation: If you need to allow more complex HTML but still want to prevent script execution, implement additional server-side validation. Libraries like bleach in Python can be configured to strip harmful content while allowing more extensive HTML formatting.
- Access Control: Limit the display of HTML fields to trusted users. If the information is sensitive or potentially harmful, consider adding an additional layer of access control to determine who can view the field.
- Educate Users: If users have any role in providing HTML content, educate them about the risks and safe practices for HTML usage. This can prevent accidental security breaches caused by well-intentioned content that contains harmful elements.
- Regular Audits: Regular security audits and reviews of the fields that allow HTML content can help ensure that no new vulnerabilities have been introduced and that existing measures are effective.
### Conclusion
> Thus, even if a field is set to be display-only, it is still subject to security risks if sanitize=False allows for raw HTML and JavaScript execution. Always consider the potential security implications of embedding HTML content in your applications and use the appropriate sanitization and security measures to protect your system and its users.


# how to avoid this risk, i need to display the html content

> If you need to display HTML content in Odoo while avoiding security risks, particularly from XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), here are several approaches you can take to ensure safety and functionality:

### 1. Use Default Sanitization
By default, Odoo provides sanitization for HTML fields. This should be your first line of defense. The default settings remove dangerous tags (like <script>) and attributes (like onclick) that could be used to execute JavaScript.

- Advantage: This method provides a good balance between security and functionality, allowing basic HTML while blocking potentially harmful content.
How to Implement: Simply do not set sanitize=False. Leave the field with default sanitization settings.
### 2. Custom Sanitization with Third-party Libraries
If the default sanitization is too restrictive and you need more control over what gets sanitized, you can use a Python library such as bleach to sanitize HTML content before it's stored or rendered.

- Advantage: Allows detailed control over which HTML tags and attributes are allowed.
- How to Implement: Use the bleach library to clean HTML content in overridden create and write methods or in a computed field.
```
from odoo import models, fields
import bleach

class YourModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'your.model'
    _description = 'Your Model Description'

    raw_html_content = fields.Text(string="Raw HTML Content")  # Store raw HTML
    safe_html_content = fields.Html(string="Safe HTML Content", compute="_compute_safe_html_content", sanitize=False)

    @api.depends('raw_html_content')
    def _compute_safe_html_content(self):
        allowed_tags = ['a', 'b', 'i', 'u', 'p', 'br', 'ul', 'ol', 'li', 'strong', 'em']
        allowed_attributes = ['href', 'title', 'style']
        for record in self:
            record.safe_html_content = bleach.clean(record.raw_html_content, tags=allowed_tags, attributes=allowed_attributes)
```
### 3. Content Security Policy (CSP)
Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) header can significantly reduce the risk of XSS. CSP allows you to specify which resources can be executed or loaded on your webpage.

- Advantage: Even if malicious content slips through sanitization, CSP can prevent it from being executed.
- How to Implement: Modify your server configuration (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to include CSP headers. For instance, to only allow scripts from your domain:
```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'
```
### 4. User Role and Access Control
Limit the ability to input and edit HTML content to trusted users. This minimizes the risk of malicious content being introduced.

- Advantage: Reduces the risk of XSS by limiting the number of users who can add or edit HTML content.
- How to Implement: Configure Odoo's access rights and record rules to control who can modify HTML fields.
### 5. Regular Audits and Monitoring
Regularly audit and monitor the HTML content and its handling in your system. Look for new vulnerabilities and ensure that sanitization rules are up to date.

- Advantage: Keeps security measures current and effective against evolving threats.
- How to Implement: Periodically review your sanitization processes, CSP settings, and user permissions.
## Conclusion
> By applying these strategies, you can display HTML content in Odoo safely, balancing functionality with security. Always consider the context in which HTML is used and choose the right combination of techniques to mitigate potential risks effectively.
