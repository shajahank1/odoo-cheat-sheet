## status bar
> In Odoo, a status bar is a visual element typically used in form views to display the current status of a record and to provide quick transitions between different statuses. It is a powerful user interface component for managing workflows and showing the progression of a record through various stages.

### Purpose and Usage of the Status Bar
The status bar allows users to quickly understand the state of an item (like a sales order, task, or project) and often includes functionality to change that state by clicking on different stages directly within the bar. This feature enhances user experience by making workflows clear and interactive.

### Key Features of the Status Bar
- Visual Representation: Provides a clear, visual representation of the possible states a record can be in.
- Interactivity: Allows users to change the state of a record by clicking on the different statuses, subject to security restrictions and business logic.
- Customizability: Developers can define what states are visible in the status bar and specify actions that occur when a state is changed.
### Implementation in Odoo
The status bar in Odoo is implemented using a combination of a Selection field in the model and a corresponding field widget in the XML view.

### Model Definition
First, you define a selection field in your model that contains the various possible states.

```
from odoo import models, fields

class ExampleModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'example.model'
    _description = 'Example Model'

    state = fields.Selection([
        ('draft', 'Draft'),
        ('confirmed', 'Confirmed'),
        ('done', 'Done'),
        ('cancelled', 'Cancelled')
    ], default='draft', string="Status")
```
In this Python code, the state field is defined with four possible statuses, setting 'Draft' as the default status when a new record is created.

#### View Definition
In the form view, you use the statusbar widget to display this field as a status bar.

```
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="view_form_example_model" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">example.model.form</field>
            <field name="model">example.model</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <form string="Example Model">
                    <header>
                        <field name="state" widget="statusbar" clickable="True" statusbar_visible="draft,confirmed,done"/>
                    </header>
                    <sheet>
                        <group>
                            <field name="name"/>
                            <!-- Additional fields -->
                        </group>
                    </sheet>
                </form>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```
### Key Attributes in the View
- widget="statusbar": Specifies that this field should be rendered as a status bar.
- clickable="True": Allows users to change the state by clicking on the different statuses directly in the status bar. This should be handled with care as it can override business logic if not properly configured.
- statusbar_visible: This attribute can be used to control which states are visible in the status bar. For example, if you want to hide 'Cancelled' from general users, you can omit it from this list.
### Practical Usage
Status bars are used extensively in Odoo for managing documents in various applications like Sales, HR, Project, etc. They help in visually representing document stages such as quotations, sales orders, invoices, tasks, leaves, recruitment processes, etc.

### Conclusion
> A status bar is an essential UI component in Odoo that helps in managing workflows efficiently. It not only provides users with immediate insights into the status of a record but also offers an intuitive way to progress records through predefined stages. This functionality enhances the workflow management capabilities of Odoo, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of business applications.
