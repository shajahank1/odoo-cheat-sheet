 ## Conditional Visibility
 In Odoo, conditional visibility refers to dynamically controlling the visibility of UI elements (like fields, buttons, groups, and pages) based on certain conditions. This feature is crucial for creating interactive and dynamic views that adapt to the context or state of data.

### Key Concepts of Conditional Visibility
Conditional visibility is primarily achieved using the attrs attribute in XML view definitions. The attrs attribute allows developers to specify conditions under which certain UI elements are visible, invisible, readonly, or required. These conditions are defined using a domain-like syntax and can depend on other fields' values in the form.

### How Conditional Visibility Works
#### Using attrs for Conditional Visibility:
- invisible: Hides the UI element when the condition is true.
- readonly: Makes the UI element non-editable when the condition is true.
- required: Makes the UI element mandatory when the condition is true.
#### Conditions:
- These are expressed in a domain-like syntax, which can include comparisons (like =, !=, >, <, <=, >=) and logical operators (and, or).
- You can reference other fields' values to make dynamic decisions about visibility or other attributes.
#### Example of Conditional Visibility
Let's consider an example where you have an employee form, and you want certain fields to only be visible if the employee is marked as a manager.


Suppose you are defining a form for hr.employee and want the manager_info group to be visible only if the is_manager field is set to True.

```
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="view_form_hr_employee" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">hr.employee.form</field>
            <field name="model">hr.employee</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <form string="Employee">
                    <sheet>
                        <group>
                            <field name="name"/>
                            <field name="is_manager"/>
                            <group string="Manager Information" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_manager', '=', False)]}">
                                <field name="department_id"/>
                            </group>
                        </group>
                    </sheet>
                </form>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```
#### In this example:

The is_manager field is a Boolean that determines whether the employee is a manager.
The Manager Information group contains fields relevant only to managers (e.g., department_id).
The attrs attribute on the manager information group uses a domain [('is_manager', '=', False)] to set the invisible property, meaning the group will be hidden unless is_manager is True.
Practical Usage
Conditional visibility is particularly useful in applications where:

Different user roles require different information.
The form needs to adapt dynamically based on data input (e.g., displaying additional options only when relevant).
Reducing clutter by hiding non-essential information unless specific conditions are met.
###CConclusion
> Conditional visibility enhances user interfaces by making them adaptive and context-sensitive. It ensures that users see only relevant information, which simplifies their workflows and improves the usability of applications. By using the attrs attribute in Odoo views, developers can effectively manage the display properties of UI elements based on dynamic conditions, tailoring the UX to meet diverse business needs.
