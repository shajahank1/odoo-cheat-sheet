# QWeb
QWeb is a templating engine used by Odoo. It allows the creation of dynamic HTML content for Odoo's front-end (website and e-commerce) and back-end (reports and views) using a syntax that is easy to understand and use. QWeb is a central part of Odoo's architecture and is used extensively to generate dynamic web pages and reports.

## Key Features and Concepts:
- XML-Based Syntax: QWeb templates are written in XML, which allows for clear structure and easy integration with HTML.
- Dynamic Content Rendering: It can render dynamic content based on the data passed to the template, which makes it highly flexible for creating complex web pages and reports.

## Expressions and Directives:

- Expressions (${}): These are used to insert Python-like expressions that are evaluated and replaced with their results in the rendered output.
- Directives: QWeb uses several directives for controlling the flow and structure of the document, such as:
- t-if: Conditional rendering of a block.
- t-foreach: Looping over a collection.
- t-esc: Output escaping (to prevent XSS attacks).
- t-raw: Outputs raw HTML.
- t-set: Assigns a value to a variable.
- t-call: Calls another template.

## Inheritance and Extension:

> QWeb templates can inherit and extend other templates, allowing for reusability and modularity.

## Use in Odoo:

- Views: Used to define the structure and layout of Odoo's views like forms, lists, and kanban boards.
- Reports: Used for generating PDF and HTML reports (such as invoices, sales orders, etc.).
- Website and E-commerce: Powers the website builder and e-commerce platform, allowing for dynamic, database-driven websites.
- Integration with Odoo's ORM:

> QWeb templates can directly interact with Odoo's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), enabling access to database records and fields, thus integrating smoothly with Odoo's backend.
## Security:
Escapes content by default to prevent XSS attacks.  
Provides mechanisms to safely render dynamic content.
## Performance:
Optimized for performance, especially in report generation where large volumes of data can be involved.  
### Example of a QWeb Template:
Here's a simple example illustrating the use of QWeb in an Odoo report:
```
<t t-name="my_module.report_example">
    <t t-foreach="docs" t-as="doc">
        <div>
            <span t-esc="doc.name"/>
            <span t-esc="doc.date_order"/>
        </div>
    </t>
</t>
```
In this example:

The t-foreach directive iterates over a collection of documents (docs).
Each document's name and date_order are rendered in a div element using the t-esc directive.
In summary, QWeb is a powerful and flexible templating engine that plays a crucial role in Odoo's UI and reporting functionalities, enabling the creation of dynamic, data-driven content in a secure and efficient manner.


# qweb vs owl?

QWeb and OWL (Odoo Web Library) are both integral parts of Odoo's frontend development, but they serve different purposes and operate in different contexts. Understanding their differences is key to effectively using them in Odoo development.

## QWeb
> Functionality: QWeb is a templating engine used primarily for generating server-side HTML, XML, or PDF content. It's also used in Odoo's frontend, but more for static HTML generation.

### Usage:

- Server-Side Rendering: Mostly used for generating reports and email templates in Odoo.
- Static Client-Side Views: Used in static parts of Odoo's client-side views, like forms and lists.
- Syntax: XML-based, with directives like t-if, t-foreach, and t-esc for dynamic content rendering.
- Integration with Odoo: Works closely with Odoo's server-side components, like models and controllers.
- Rendering: QWeb templates are processed and rendered on the server before being sent to the client.

## OWL (Odoo Web Library)
> Functionality: OWL is a modern JavaScript framework developed by Odoo for creating reactive and dynamic user interfaces. It is component-based and uses a virtual DOM for efficient rendering.

### Usage:

Dynamic Client-Side Applications: Primarily used for building interactive and dynamic web client applications in Odoo.
Reactivity and State Management: Ideal for parts of the application where the UI needs to react to user interactions and data changes in real-time.
Syntax: Uses JavaScript (or TypeScript) and resembles other modern JS frameworks like React or Vue.js. It allows the creation of encapsulated components.

Integration with Odoo: Designed to work seamlessly with Odoo's web client and can interact with Odoo's backend via JSON-RPC.

Rendering: Components are rendered on the client-side, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience.

### Key Differences
- Context of Use: QWeb is more server-side and static, used for reports and non-interactive views. OWL is used for interactive, client-side web applications.
- Technology: QWeb is XML-based and template-driven, while OWL is a JavaScript framework using a component-based approach.
- Dynamic vs. Static: QWeb is suited for static rendering, while OWL is designed for creating dynamic, reactive UIs.
- Rendering Location: QWeb templates are usually rendered server-side, whereas OWL components are rendered client-side.

### Conclusion
- Choose QWeb: When you need to generate static HTML, PDF reports, or email templates, especially those that don't require client-side interactivity.
- Choose OWL: For building dynamic, interactive web applications that require real-time updates and reactivity, akin to what is offered by modern JavaScript frameworks.
> Both QWeb and OWL are essential for Odoo developers, but they cater to different aspects of the Odoo application development process. Understanding where and how to use each can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Odoo development projects.


> OWL (Odoo Web Library) does indeed utilize QWeb, but it adapts it for client-side rendering, which is a significant shift from the traditional server-side rendering for which QWeb is typically known. Here's how OWL integrates QWeb and what this means for template design in OWL:

### OWL's Adaptation of QWeb
- Client-Side QWeb: OWL employs a version of QWeb that is adapted for client-side rendering. This means that while the templating syntax is similar to the server-side QWeb used in Odoo, it operates within the context of a JavaScript framework on the client side.

- Templates in OWL Components: In OWL, QWeb templates are defined as part of JavaScript components. These templates dictate the HTML structure of the component, and they are rendered in the browser, allowing for dynamic and reactive interfaces.

### Template Design in OWL
- Syntax: The QWeb syntax used in OWL is largely the same as server-side QWeb. It includes directives like t-if, t-foreach, t-esc, etc., allowing for similar control structures and data binding capabilities.

- Integration with JavaScript: OWL components combine QWeb templates with JavaScript logic. This integration allows developers to create interactive UI components where the JavaScript part manages the state and logic, and the QWeb template defines the HTML structure based on that state.

- Reactivity: One of the key features of OWL is its reactive system. When the state of a component changes, the component automatically re-renders to reflect those changes. The QWeb templates within OWL components are designed to update efficiently in response to state changes.

### Example of OWL Component with QWeb Template:

```
import { Component, useState } from '@odoo/owl';

class MyComponent extends Component {
    setup() {
        this.state = useState({ counter: 0 });
    }
    increment() {
        this.state.counter++;
    }
}

MyComponent.template = 'MyComponentTemplate';

MyComponent.components = { MyComponentTemplate: xml`
    <div>
        <span t-esc="state.counter"/>
        <button t-on-click="increment">Increment</button>
    </div>
`};
```
> In this example, the OWL component MyComponent has a QWeb template defined inline. The template reacts to the state.counter and updates the view when the increment function is called.

### Conclusion
> While OWL uses QWeb for its templating, it's important to understand that it's a client-side adaptation, integrated within JavaScript components for reactive UIs. This combination of OWL's reactive component system and QWeb's templating capabilities makes it a powerful tool for developing dynamic user interfaces in Odoo.

_______________________

##  directives and attributes 

> QWeb, Odoo's templating engine, provides several directives and attributes that allow for dynamic rendering of content. Each directive serves a specific purpose, enabling developers to create complex, data-driven templates. Here's an overview of these directives along with examples:

- 1. t-esc
Purpose: Escapes and outputs a value. Used for displaying text or values from expressions.
Example: <span t-esc="product.name"/> displays the name of a product, escaping any HTML characters.
- 2. t-raw
Purpose: Outputs raw HTML. Use with caution as it can lead to security issues like XSS.
Example: <div t-raw="product.description_html"/> displays HTML content of a product description without escaping.
- 3. t-set
Purpose: Assigns a value to a variable.
Example: <t t-set="total" t-value="order.amount_total"/> sets the total variable to the order's total amount.
- 4. t-if
Purpose: Conditionally renders the enclosed block.
Example: <t t-if="order.state == 'draft'">Draft Order</t> displays 'Draft Order' if the order is in draft state.
- 5. t-elif
Purpose: An 'else if' for the t-if directive.
Example:
```
<t t-if="order.state == 'draft'">Draft</t>
<t t-elif="order.state == 'confirmed'">Confirmed</t>
```
- 6. t-else
Purpose: An 'else' for the t-if directive.
```
<t t-if="order.state == 'draft'">Draft</t>
<t t-else="">Other State</t>
```
- 7. t-foreach
Purpose: Iterates over a collection.
Example:
```
<ul>
  <li t-foreach="order.line_ids" t-as="line">
    <span t-esc="line.product_id.name"/>
  </li>
</ul>
```
- 8. t-as
Purpose: Names the current item in a t-foreach loop.
Example: See t-foreach example above.
- 9. t-call
Purpose: Calls another template.
Example: <t t-call="my_module.other_template"/> includes the 'other_template' in the current position.
- 10. t-att
Purpose: Dynamically sets an HTML attribute.
Example: <div t-att-class="'color-' + product.color"/> sets the class attribute based on product color.
- 11. t-attf
Purpose: Formats an HTML attribute with variables.
- 12. t-field
Purpose: Special directive for displaying a field with formatting based on its type.
Example: <span t-field="order.date_order"/> displays the order date with proper formatting.
- 13. t-esc-options
Purpose: Allows specifying options for t-esc like widget, format, etc.
Example: <span t-esc="order.date_order" t-esc-options='{"widget": "date"}'/> formats the date order.
- 14. t-debug
Purpose: Used for debugging. It shows the available variables and their values at that point in the template.
Example: <t t-debug=""/>
- 15. t-jquery
Purpose: Executes jQuery commands on the selected element.
Example: <div t-jquery="span" t-operation="append">Content</div> appends 'Content' to all span elements inside the div.
### Conclusion
> These directives provide a powerful toolkit for creating dynamic and interactive templates in Odoo. They allow developers to build templates that react to data and user inputs, making them essential for crafting user interfaces and reports in Odoo applications.
_________________________

## Condtional Display

Conditional viewing in Odoo, particularly in QWeb templates, is typically handled using the t-if, t-elif, and t-else directives. These directives allow you to display content conditionally based on the evaluation of expressions. Here's how to implement conditional viewing with an example:

Basic Usage of t-if, t-elif, and t-else
t-if: This directive is used to evaluate a condition. If the condition is True, the content inside the block will be rendered.

```
<t t-if="condition">
    <!-- content to display if condition is True -->
</t>
t-elif: This is an "else if" condition that can follow a t-if. It is evaluated if the previous t-if or t-elif was False.
```
```
<t t-elif="another_condition">
    <!-- content to display if another_condition is True -->
</t>
t-else: This is used for the else part, which is rendered if none of the preceding t-if or t-elif conditions are met.
```
```
<t t-else="">
    <!-- content to display if all above conditions are False -->
</t>
```
### Example: Displaying Order Status
Assume you want to display different messages based on the status of an order (draft, confirmed, done). Here's how you might implement this:

```
<t t-if="order.state == 'draft'">
    <span>Draft Order</span>
</t>
<t t-elif="order.state == 'confirmed'">
    <span>Order Confirmed</span>
</t>
<t t-elif="order.state == 'done'">
    <span>Order Completed</span>
</t>
<t t-else="">
    <span>Order in Unknown State</span>
</t>
```
In this example:

If order.state is draft, it displays "Draft Order".
If order.state is confirmed, it displays "Order Confirmed".
If order.state is done, it displays "Order Completed".
If none of these conditions are met, it displays "Order in Unknown State".
Tips for Implementation
Ensure that the expressions in t-if and t-elif are valid and correctly reference the fields or variables you want to evaluate.
Be mindful of the order of t-if, t-elif, and t-else blocks; Odoo evaluates them sequentially.
Remember that these directives can be used in both server-side templates (for views and reports) and client-side templates (within OWL components).
Using these conditional directives, you can create responsive and dynamic templates in Odoo that adapt to the underlying data, enhancing the user experience and the overall functionality of your Odoo application.
_____________________
## Styling with CSS

Styling QWeb templates in Odoo with CSS can be done in several ways, similar to how you would style traditional HTML content. Here are the 

### common methods:

### 1. Inline CSS
Directly apply styles to HTML elements using the style attribute.
Suitable for small, one-off style changes.
Example:

```
<span style="color: red;">Important Notice</span>
```
### 2. Class-based CSS
Define CSS classes in a separate stylesheet.
Use the class attribute in your QWeb templates to apply these styles.
This is the recommended approach for maintaining a consistent look and reusability.
**Example**:

```
<!-- In your QWeb template -->
<div class="custom-class">Content</div>
```

```
/* In a CSS file (e.g., static/src/css/custom_styles.css) */
.custom-class {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
}

```
### 3. External Stylesheets
Link to external CSS files in your QWeb template or HTML header.
Ideal for applying global styles or using external libraries.
**Example**:

```
<t t-call="web.external_layout">
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path_to_your_css_file.css"/>
    <div class="external-style">Content</div>
</t>
```
### 4. Asset Bundling
Odoo uses a system called 'assets' to manage and bundle CSS and JavaScript files.
Add your CSS files to an asset bundle to ensure they are loaded where necessary.
This method helps with performance optimization.
**Example:**

Add your CSS file to an asset bundle in an XML file within your module:
```
<template id="assets_backend" name="custom_assets" inherit_id="web.assets_backend">
    <xpath expr="." position="inside">
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/your_module/static/src/css/custom_styles.css"/>
    </xpath>
</template>
```
### Best Practices for Styling in Odoo
- Consistency: Stick to Odoo's styling conventions where possible. Use existing classes and UI elements to maintain consistency across your application.
- Maintainability: Prefer class-based styling over inline for easier maintenance and better performance.
- Asset Management: Utilize Odoo's asset bundling system for efficient loading and management of your stylesheets.
- Responsive Design: Ensure your styles are responsive and adapt well to different screen sizes, especially if they're for the frontend or website.
> By following these methods and best practices, you can effectively apply CSS styling to your QWeb templates in Odoo, creating visually appealing and consistent user interfaces.

## Example
Sure, I'll provide a comprehensive example that demonstrates how to style a QWeb template using CSS in an Odoo module. This example will include a QWeb report template, a CSS file, and the necessary XML to integrate everything into an Odoo module.

Step 1: Create the CSS File
First, create a CSS file in your module's static/src/css directory. Let's call this file custom_report_style.css.

your_module/static/src/css/custom_report_style.css:

```
.report-header {
    background-color: #4CAF50;
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 8px 0;
}

.report-body {
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 15px;
    background-color: #f2f2f2;
    border-radius: 5px;
}
```
### Step 2: Add the CSS File to an Asset Bundle
Next, include your CSS file in an asset bundle. This is done in an XML file within your module (usually in views directory).

your_module/views/assets.xml:

```
<odoo>
    <template id="assets_backend" name="custom_assets" inherit_id="web.assets_backend">
        <xpath expr="." position="inside">
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/your_module/static/src/css/custom_report_style.css"/>
        </xpath>
    </template>
</odoo>
```
### Step 3: Create the QWeb Template
Now, create a QWeb report template that uses the classes defined in your CSS file.

your_module/views/report_template.xml:

```
<odoo>
    <template id="report_template_example">
        <t t-call="web.html_container">
            <t t-foreach="docs" t-as="doc">
                <div class="report-header">
                    <h2>Report for <t t-esc="doc.name"/></h2>
                </div>
                <div class="report-body">
                    <p>Report content for <t t-esc="doc.name"/></p>
                    <!-- Add more report content here -->
                </div>
            </t>
        </t>
    </template>
</odoo>
```
### Step 4: Register the Templates in __manifest__.py
Ensure that the XML files are referenced in your module's manifest.

your_module/__manifest__.py:

```
{
    'name': 'Your Module',
    'version': '1.0',
    'category': 'Custom',
    'summary': 'A Custom Module',
    'depends': ['base'],
    'data': [
        'views/assets.xml',
        'views/report_template.xml',
    ],
    # other manifest entries
}
```
## Summary
> The CSS file custom_report_style.css defines two classes: report-header and report-body.
The assets.xml file adds this CSS file to the Odoo backend assets bundle.
The report_template.xml file creates a QWeb template that uses these classes.
The __manifest__.py file ensures that the XML files are loaded by the module.
With these steps, your QWeb template in Odoo will have custom styling applied via the CSS classes defined in your module. This approach keeps your CSS separate from your QWeb templates, ensuring clean, maintainable code.
______________________
## Dynamic content generation
Dynamic content generation in QWeb, Odoo's templating engine, refers to the ability to render content in templates based on dynamic data or conditions. This feature is crucial for creating templates that adapt to different data inputs, user interactions, or application states. Let's explore this concept with an example:

### Example: Displaying a List of Products
Scenario:
Suppose you want to create a QWeb template that displays a list of products. The list should dynamically adjust to the number of products available and their details.

### Step 1: Data Preparation
First, ensure that your Odoo model (e.g., product.product) contains the data you want to display. For this example, assume you have a list of product records, each with attributes like name and price.

### Step 2: QWeb Template
Create a QWeb template that iterates over the product records and dynamically generates HTML content based on the product data.

your_module/views/product_template.xml:

```
<odoo>
    <template id="product_list_template">
        <div class="product-list">
            <t t-if="products">
                <ul>
                    <t t-foreach="products" t-as="product">
                        <li>
                            <span t-field="product.name"/> - 
                            <span t-field="product.price"/>$
                        </li>
                    </t>
                </ul>
            </t>
            <t t-else="">
                <p>No products available.</p>
            </t>
        </div>
    </template>
</odoo>
```
### Explanation
The <t t-foreach="products" t-as="product"> directive iterates over the products collection. For each product in products, the content inside the loop is rendered.
The t-field directive is used to display the product's name and price. It automatically handles escaping and formatting based on the field's data type.
The t-if and t-else directives create a conditional block. If there are products (products is truthy), it renders the list. If there are no products, it displays a message "No products available."
### Step 3: Integrating the Template
To display this template in an Odoo view, you would typically integrate it into an action or a menu item. This integration requires backend Python code to pass the products data to the template.

### Summary
> In this example, the dynamic content generation is demonstrated by the template's ability to adapt to the number of products and their details. If the list of products changes, the template automatically updates to reflect these changes. This feature is fundamental in Odoo for creating responsive and interactive user interfaces that reflect the current state of the application's data.

__________
### 2. Data Binding and Expression Evaluation with eg 

Data binding and expression evaluation in QWeb, Odoo's templating engine, involve dynamically linking QWeb template elements to data models (like records from the database) and evaluating expressions within the template. This feature allows the template to display and update data dynamically based on the underlying data model.

### Example: Displaying Order Details
**Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you want to create a QWeb template to display details of a sales order, such as the customer's name, order date, and total amount.

### Step 1: Data Model
Assume you have a sales order model (sale.order) with fields like partner_id (Customer), date_order (Order Date), and amount_total (Total Amount).

### Step 2: QWeb Template
Create a QWeb template that binds these fields to display the order details.

your_module/views/order_detail_template.xml:

```
<odoo>
    <template id="order_detail_template">
        <div class="order-details">
            <h2>Order Details</h2>
            <p><strong>Customer:</strong> <span t-esc="order.partner_id.name"/></p>
            <p><strong>Order Date:</strong> <span t-esc="order.date_order" t-esc-options='{"widget": "date"}'/></p>
            <p><strong>Total Amount:</strong> <span t-esc="order.amount_total"/> $</p>
        </div>
    </template>
</odoo>
```
#### Explanation
- Data Binding: The t-esc directive is used to bind data from the order record to the template. For instance, t-esc="order.partner_id.name" - displays the customer's name.
- Expression Evaluation: Expressions inside t-esc are evaluated to get the values. For example, order.date_order fetches the order date from the order record.
- Formatting: The t-esc-options attribute allows you to specify options for formatting. Here, it's used to format order.date_order as a date.
### Step 3: Using the Template
This template would typically be used in a report or a view in Odoo. The order variable needs to be provided by the backend (a controller or report action) when rendering this template.

### Summary
> In this example, data binding is illustrated by how the template elements are directly tied to the fields of the sale.order record. Any changes to the order's fields (like the customer's name or the total amount) would be reflected in the template when it's rendered. Expression evaluation is shown through the use of t-esc and t-esc-options to display and format the order details. This functionality is key in Odoo for creating dynamic, data-driven templates that reflect the current state of application data.

## 4. HTML Escaping 

HTML escaping in QWeb, Odoo's templating engine, is a critical feature for ensuring the security and integrity of web content. It involves converting certain characters in strings into HTML entities to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML code. This process is essential to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web pages.

### Example: Safely Displaying User Input
Scenario:
Imagine a scenario in an Odoo application where you want to display a comment or a message entered by a user. User input can potentially contain HTML tags or JavaScript code, which, if rendered as-is, could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

### Step 1: User Input
Let's say a user submits a comment on a forum post, and this comment is stored in a field called comment in a model forum.post.

### Step 2: QWeb Template Without HTML Escaping
Here's how you might incorrectly display the comment without HTML escaping:

your_module/views/forum_post_template.xml (Incorrect Approach):

```
<odoo>
    <template id="forum_post_template">
        <div class="post-comment">
            <!-- This is unsafe if comment contains HTML or JavaScript -->
            <div t-raw="post.comment"></div>
        </div>
    </template>
</odoo>
```
### Step 3: QWeb Template With HTML Escaping
The correct approach is to use t-esc for HTML escaping:

your_module/views/forum_post_template.xml (Correct Approach):

```
<odoo>
    <template id="forum_post_template">
        <div class="post-comment">
            <!-- Safely display user comment -->
            <div t-esc="post.comment"></div>
        </div>
    </template>
</odoo>
```
### Explanation
Without HTML Escaping (t-raw): The t-raw directive will render the content of post.comment as HTML, including any HTML tags or JavaScript. This is unsafe as it can lead to XSS attacks.
With HTML Escaping (t-esc): The t-esc directive automatically escapes HTML characters in post.comment. For example, < is converted to &lt;, > to &gt;, and so on. This prevents any HTML tags or scripts in the user input from being executed.
### Summary
> HTML escaping is vital for preventing XSS attacks in web applications, including those built with Odoo. The t-esc directive in QWeb should be used whenever displaying user-generated content or any data that might contain HTML or JavaScript code. This ensures that such content is safely rendered as text, not as executable HTML or JavaScript.

## 5. Template Inheritance and Extension 

Template inheritance and extension in QWeb, Odoo's templating engine, are powerful features that enable reusability and maintainability in template design. They allow you to build new templates based on existing ones, either by extending them or overriding specific parts.

### Template Inheritance
- Purpose: Inherits the entire structure of an existing template and allows you to add additional content.
- Use Case: Useful when you want to keep all the original content of a base template and just add more content to it.
### Template Extension
- Purpose: Extends a template by overriding specific parts (blocks) within it.
Use Case: Useful when you need to modify or replace parts of a base template without rewriting the whole template.
### Example: Extending a Base Template
Base Template
Assume there's a base template for a standard webpage layout in your module.

your_module/views/base_template.xml:

```
<odoo>
    <template id="base_layout">
        <div class="header">
            <t t-call="your_module.header"/>
        </div>
        <div class="body">
            <t t-esc="body_content"/>
        </div>
        <div class="footer">
            <t t-call="your_module.footer"/>
        </div>
    </template>
</odoo>
```
Extending the Base Template
Now, let's create a new template for a specific webpage that extends this base layout but adds some specific content to the body.

your_module/views/specific_page_template.xml:

```
<odoo>
    <template id="specific_page_layout" inherit_id="your_module.base_layout">
        <xpath expr="//div[@class='body']" position="replace">
            <div class="body">
                <h1>Welcome to Our Special Page</h1>
                <p>This is some specific content for the special page.</p>
            </div>
        </xpath>
    </template>
</odoo>
```
### Explanation
- Base Template: The base_layout template defines a basic webpage structure with a header, body, and footer.
- Extension: The specific_page_layout template extends the base layout. It uses the inherit_id attribute to specify the base template it extends.
- XPath: The <xpath> element targets the body part of the base template (using an XPath expression) and replaces it with new content.
### Summary
> Template inheritance and extension in QWeb allow for efficient template management by enabling you to build upon existing templates. This approach promotes reusability, keeps templates organized, and makes it easier to maintain and update your UI. In the given example, the specific page layout is created by extending a base layout and customizing the body content, demonstrating how different pages can share a common structure while having their unique content.

_____________
## Modularity and Reusability 

Modularity and reusability are key principles in software development, including when working with QWeb, Odoo's templating engine. These principles help in creating maintainable, scalable, and efficient code.

### Modularity
- Definition: Breaking down a system into separate, distinct components, each responsible for a part of the functionality.
- Advantage: Makes the system easier to understand, develop, and maintain.
### Reusability
- Definition: Designing components to be used in multiple different contexts or applications.
- Advantage: Saves time and effort, as the same component can be used in multiple places without rewriting code.
### Example: Creating Reusable QWeb Components
Scenario:
Suppose you have an Odoo module for an e-commerce website where you frequently display product details in various views (product page, shopping cart, order summary, etc.).

### Step 1: Creating a Reusable Product Snippet
First, create a QWeb snippet (component) that can be used to display a product's details.

your_module/views/product_snippet.xml:

```
<odoo>
    <template id="product_snippet">
        <div class="product">
            <img t-att-src="'/path/to/images/' + product.image" alt="Product Image"/>
            <h3 t-esc="product.name"/>
            <p t-esc="product.description"/>
            <span t-esc="product.price" t-esc-options='{"widget": "monetary"}'/>$
        </div>
    </template>
</odoo>
```
### Step 2: Using the Snippet in Different Views
You can now use this snippet in multiple places across your application.

In a Product Page:

```
<t t-call="your_module.product_snippet">
    <t t-set="product" t-value="selected_product"/>
</t>
```
In a Shopping Cart:

```
<t t-foreach="cart_products" t-as="product">
    <t t-call="your_module.product_snippet"/>
</t>
```
In an Order Summary:

```
<t t-foreach="order_products" t-as="product">
    <t t-call="your_module.product_snippet"/>
</t>
```
### Explanation
- Reusable Component (product_snippet): This template is designed as a standalone snippet that can display product details. It expects a product variable to be set when it's called.
- Modularity: The product snippet is a self-contained module that can be independently developed and tested.
- Reusability: The same snippet is reused in different contexts (product page, shopping cart, order summary), ensuring consistency and reducing duplication.
### Summary
> Modularity and reusability, as demonstrated in this example, are fundamental for creating efficient and maintainable applications in Odoo. By designing reusable components (like the product_snippet), you can simplify development and ensure consistency across different parts of your application.

## 7. Integration with Odoo's ORM 

Integration with Odoo's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a fundamental aspect of QWeb templates. This integration allows QWeb to access and display data directly from the Odoo database, leveraging the powerful features of Odoo's ORM, such as data retrieval, computation, and manipulation.

### Understanding Odoo's ORM Integration
- ORM: Odoo's ORM provides an abstraction layer over the database, allowing developers to interact with the database using Python objects rather than SQL queries.
- Data Models: In Odoo, data models (like sale.order, product.product) represent database tables. They define fields (columns) and behaviors (methods) for business objects.
- QWeb Access to ORM: QWeb templates can access these models and their records. This means that you can display and manipulate database records directly within your templates.
### Example: Displaying a List of Sales Orders
Scenario:
Imagine you want to create a QWeb report that lists all sales orders, showing details like the order number, customer name, and total amount.

### Step 1: Define the Data in Python
First, you might have a Python method that retrieves the list of sales orders. This could be part of a model or a controller.

Python Method in a Model or Controller:

```
class SaleOrderReport(models.AbstractModel):
    _name = 'report.your_module.sale_order_report'

    def _get_sale_orders(self):
        return self.env['sale.order'].search([])
```
### Step 2: QWeb Template
Next, create a QWeb template that iterates over these sales orders.

your_module/views/sale_order_report_template.xml:

```
<odoo>
    <template id="sale_order_report">
        <t t-call="web.html_container">
            <t t-foreach="_get_sale_orders()" t-as="order">
                <div class="order">
                    <p><strong>Order:</strong> <span t-esc="order.name"/></p>
                    <p><strong>Customer:</strong> <span t-esc="order.partner_id.name"/></p>
                    <p><strong>Total:</strong> <span t-esc="order.amount_total" t-esc-options='{"widget": "monetary"}'/></p>
                </div>
            </t>
        </t>
    </template>
</odoo>
```
### Explanation
- Data Retrieval: The _get_sale_orders method in the model retrieves sales order records using Odoo's ORM.
- QWeb Template: The template iterates over the sales order records using t-foreach.
- Data Display: For each order, it displays the order name, customer name, and total amount. The t-esc directive safely renders these values.
### Summary
> This example illustrates how QWeb templates can directly integrate with Odoo's ORM to retrieve and display data. This integration is powerful, enabling the creation of dynamic and data-driven templates in Odoo. By leveraging the ORM, you can present complex data structures in an easily understandable format, enhancing the overall functionality and user experience of your Odoo application.

## 8. Server-Side and Client-Side Rendering 

In Odoo, QWeb templates can be used for both server-side and client-side rendering. This flexibility allows developers to choose the most appropriate rendering method depending on the use case.

### Server-Side Rendering
- Description: Server-side rendering involves processing the QWeb templates on the Odoo server. The final HTML is generated on the server and sent to the client (browser).
- Use Cases: Typically used for generating reports, PDFs, or any HTML that needs to be fully rendered before being sent to the client.
- Advantage: Allows access to the full Odoo environment, including models and server-side logic.
### Example: Generating a PDF Report
A typical example of server-side rendering is creating a PDF report of sales orders.

**Python Code (Controller or Report Action):**

```
class ReportSaleOrder(models.AbstractModel):
    _name = 'report.your_module.report_sale_order'

    # Logic to fetch data

```

**QWeb Template:**
```
<odoo>
    <template id="report_sale_order_template">
        <!-- HTML and QWeb Directives to layout the report -->
        <div t-foreach="docs" t-as="order">
            <h2>Order: <span t-esc="order.name"/></h2>
            <!-- Additional details here -->
        </div>
    </template>
</odoo>
```
### Client-Side Rendering
- Description: Client-side rendering is where the QWeb templates are processed in the client's browser, typically using JavaScript.
- Use Cases: Used in dynamic web pages where content needs to change without reloading the entire page.
- Advantage: Enhances user experience with dynamic updates and reduces server load.
### Example: Dynamic Content Update in a Web Page
An example is updating a part of a web page with new data without reloading the entire page.

JavaScript Code:
```
odoo.define('your_module.SomeWidget', function (require) {
    'use strict';

    var core = require('web.core');
    var Widget = require('web.Widget');
    var QWeb = core.qweb;

    var SomeWidget = Widget.extend({
        template: 'your_module.SomeTemplate',
        // ... Widget logic ...
        renderElement: function () {
            this._super();
            // Logic to dynamically update content
        },
    });

    return SomeWidget;
});
```
QWeb Template:

```
<odoo>
    <template id="your_module.SomeTemplate">
        <div>
            <!-- Dynamic content here -->
            <span t-esc="dynamic_value"/>
        </div>
    </template>
</odoo>
```
### Summary
> In summary, server-side rendering in Odoo is used for generating static content like reports and is processed on the server, while client-side rendering is used for dynamic, interactive web pages and is processed in the browser. Both methods have their specific use cases and advantages, and Odoo's flexibility in supporting both allows developers to build a wide range of applications and features.
_______________
## 9. Customization with Directives

Customization with directives in QWeb, Odoo's templating engine, involves using specific instructions within your templates to control how they are processed and rendered. These directives provide powerful ways to manipulate the content and structure of your templates dynamically.

### Understanding Directives
- Directives: Special commands in a QWeb template that instruct the engine on how to process certain parts of the template.
- Purpose: They are used for iteration, conditional rendering, variable setting, content escaping, and more.
- Example: Creating a Custom Invoice Template
### Scenario:
Suppose you want to create a custom invoice template that lists products, applies a discount under certain conditions, and calculates a total amount.

Step 1: QWeb Template with Custom Directives
Here's an example of how you might use various QWeb directives to achieve this:

your_module/views/invoice_template.xml:

```
<odoo>
    <template id="custom_invoice_template">
        <!-- Loop through each product line -->
        <ul>
            <t t-foreach="invoice_line_ids" t-as="line">
                <li>
                    <span t-esc="line.product_id.name"/> - 
                    <span t-esc="line.quantity"/> x 
                    <span t-esc="line.price_unit"/>$
                </li>

                <!-- Apply discount for specific conditions -->
                <t t-if="line.discount &gt; 0">
                    <li style="color: red;">
                        Discount: <t t-esc="line.discount"/>%
                    </li>
                </t>
            </t>
        </ul>

        <!-- Calculate and display total -->
        <div>
            Total: <span t-esc="sum(line.quantity * line.price_unit for line in invoice_line_ids)"/>$
        </div>
    </template>
</odoo>
```
### Explanation
- t-foreach and t-as: These directives are used to iterate over the invoice lines (invoice_line_ids). For each line, it creates a list item (<li>) displaying the product name, quantity, and unit price.
- t-if: This conditional directive checks if a discount is applied (i.e., line.discount > 0). If true, it renders an additional list item showing the discount.
- Python Expression: The total amount is calculated using a Python expression inside t-esc, summing the product of quantity and price for each line.
### Summary
> In this example, various QWeb directives are used to create a dynamic and interactive invoice template. By leveraging directives like t-foreach, t-as, and t-if, along with Python expressions, you can build complex and data-driven templates in Odoo. This approach showcases the power and flexibility of QWeb in customizing templates to meet specific business requirements.

##  Reports

Using QWeb in Odoo for creating reports involves several steps: defining a report action, creating a QWeb template for the report, and possibly adding custom logic in a Python class if needed. Reports in Odoo are typically PDF documents generated from QWeb templates.

Step 1: Define the Report Action
First, you need to define a report action in XML. This action tells Odoo what report to generate, what model it's related to, and which QWeb template to use.

Example: Let's create a report action for a sales order report.

your_module/views/report_action.xml:

```
<odoo>
    <record id="action_report_saleorder" model="ir.actions.report">
        <field name="name">Sale Order Report</field>
        <field name="model">sale.order</field>
        <field name="report_type">qweb-pdf</field>
        <field name="report_name">your_module.report_saleorder_document</field>
        <field name="report_file">your_module.report_saleorder_document</field>
        <field name="binding_model_id" ref="sale.model_sale_order"/>
        <field name="binding_type">report</field>
    </record>
</odoo>
```
Step 2: Create a QWeb Template for the Report
Next, create a QWeb template that defines the layout and content of the report.

your_module/views/sale_order_report_template.xml:

```
<odoo>
    <template id="report_saleorder_document">
        <t t-call="web.html_container">
            <t t-foreach="docs" t-as="o">
                <t t-call="web.external_layout">
                    <div class="page">
                        <h2>Sale Order: <span t-esc="o.name"/></h2>
                        <p>Customer: <span t-esc="o.partner_id.name"/></p>
                        <!-- More report content -->
                    </div>
                </t>
            </t>
        </t>
    </template>
</odoo>
```
Step 3: Optionally Add Custom Logic in Python
If you need to preprocess data or add custom logic before rendering the report, you can do this in a Python class.

your_module/models/report_sale_order.py:

```
from odoo import api, models

class ReportSaleOrder(models.AbstractModel):
    _name = 'report.your_module.report_saleorder_document'

    @api.model
    def _get_report_values(self, docids, data=None):
        docs = self.env['sale.order'].browse(docids)
        return {
            'doc_ids': docids,
            'doc_model': 'sale.order',
            'docs': docs,
            # Add more context or preprocess data here
        }
```
Step 4: Register the Report and Template
Make sure to include your XML and Python files in the module's manifest (__manifest__.py) under the 'data' and 'report' keys respectively.

your_module/__manifest__.py:

```
{
    # ... other manifest entries ...
    'data': [
        'views/report_action.xml',
        'views/sale_order_report_template.xml',
        # ... other data files ...
    ],
    'report': [
        'models/report_sale_order.py',
    ],
}
````
### Summary
> In this example, you define a report action for a sales order report, create a QWeb template for the report layout, and optionally add a Python class for any custom logic needed. The report action specifies the model (sale.order), report type (qweb-pdf), and the report template to use. The QWeb template (report_saleorder_document) defines the structure and content of the report. This setup allows you to generate custom PDF reports from your Odoo application, leveraging the power of QWeb and Odoo's reporting framework.
