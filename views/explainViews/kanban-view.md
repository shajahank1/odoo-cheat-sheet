# Kanban View
A Kanban View in Odoo is a dynamic and visual representation of records, typically used to manage workflows and processes. It presents data in a card-like format, grouped into columns, often reflecting different stages or categories.

### Key Characteristics of a Kanban View
- Card-Based Layout: Each record is represented as a card. The content of these cards can be customized to show relevant information.

- Columns: Records are grouped into columns, usually representing stages in a workflow (like 'To Do', 'In Progress', 'Done' in a project management application).

- Drag and Drop: Allows for intuitive drag-and-drop interactions, enabling users to move records between different stages or categories easily.

- Customizable: The look and feel of the cards and the information displayed on them can be customized.

- Integration with Actions: Clicking on a Kanban card typically opens the corresponding form view for the record, allowing for detailed editing.

### Creating a Kanban View
Kanban Views are defined in XML, where you specify how the records should be grouped and what information should be displayed on the cards.

### Example of a Kanban View
Consider a model project.task. Here's an example of a Kanban View for managing tasks:

```
<record id="view_kanban_project_task" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">project.task.kanban</field>
    <field name="model">project.task</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <kanban default_group_by="stage_id">
            <field name="name"/>
            <field name="stage_id"/>
            <templates>
                <t t-name="kanban-box">
                    <div class="oe_kanban_global_click">
                        <div class="oe_kanban_details">
                            <field name="name"/>
                            <!-- Additional fields and layout elements -->
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </t>
            </templates>
        </kanban>
    </field>
</record>
```
### In this example:

> The Kanban View is for the model project.task.
The view is grouped by stage_id, which could represent different stages of a task.
Each Kanban card displays the task's name and other details as specified.
The <templates> tag is used to customize the layout and content of the Kanban cards.
### Best Practices
- Field Selection: Carefully select which fields to display on the cards for quick identification of records.
- Usability: Ensure that the Kanban view is easy to use and understand, with clear labels for columns and concise information on cards.
- Performance: Optimize for performance, especially if the view is expected to load a large number of records.
- Mobile Responsiveness: Consider how the Kanban view will appear on smaller screens and ensure it remains functional and user-friendly.
- Workflow Representation: Use the Kanban view to effectively represent and manage workflows or processes, ensuring that the stages or categories are meaningful and intuitive.
> Kanban views in Odoo provide an engaging and interactive way to visualize and manage tasks or workflows, enhancing user experience and productivity. They are particularly useful in scenarios where the visual management of records and their stages is important.
