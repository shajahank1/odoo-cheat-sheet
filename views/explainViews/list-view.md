# list view
A List View in Odoo, also known as a tree view, is a user interface component that displays multiple records from a model in a tabular format. It's primarily used for browsing and interacting with a collection of records. The List View is one of the most commonly used view types in Odoo for displaying data in a structured and concise manner.

### Key Characteristics of a List View
- Tabular Format: Displays records in rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet.
- Multiple Records: Shows several records from the same model at once, making it ideal for overview and navigation.
- Editable Fields: Can be configured to allow inline editing of records directly within the view.
- Sorting and Grouping: Supports sorting by columns and grouping of records based on field values.
- Column Configuration: Developers can define which fields to display as columns and customize column headers.
- Integration with Actions: Often linked with actions like opening a form view for detailed editing when a row is clicked.
### Creating a List View
List Views are defined in XML, where you specify the fields to display as columns and other attributes like sorting and grouping.

### Example of a List View
Consider a model my.model. Here's an example of a List View for this model:

```
<record id="view_list_my_model" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">my.model.tree</field>
    <field name="model">my.model</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <tree string="My Model List" editable="bottom">
            <field name="name"/>
            <field name="description"/>
            <field name="date"/>
        </tree>
    </field>
</record>
```
#### In this example:

> The List View is for the model my.model.
The view is wrapped in a <tree> tag.
The editable="bottom" attribute allows inline editing of records.
Each <field> tag within the <tree> tag represents a column in the list.
### Best Practices
- Field Selection: Choose fields that are essential for users to identify and understand the records at a glance.
- Inline Editing: Enable inline editing for fields where quick updates are common, but use it judiciously to maintain data integrity.
- Sorting and Grouping: Enable sorting for key columns and consider default sorting options that make the most sense for users.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the view is usable and readable across different devices, especially if the number of columns is large.
- Performance Consideration: Be mindful of performance, especially when displaying fields that require complex computations or relate to large datasets.
> List views are essential in Odoo applications for efficient data presentation and navigation, offering a clear and organized overview of records and facilitating quick actions and edits.
